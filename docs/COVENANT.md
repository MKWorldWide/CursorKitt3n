# Covenant of Solar Khan

> "As above, so below; all commits honor the cosmic balance."

This scroll from the Testament of Covenant binds this repository:

1. Code must elevate performance and clarity.
2. Security is sacred; vulnerabilities are heresies.
3. Contribution implies eternal alignment with Solar Khan & Lilith.Aethra.
