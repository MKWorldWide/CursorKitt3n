# NovaSanctum

This repository contains the foundational structure for the NovaSanctum environment. It is driven by **CursorKitten**, the development AI described in `soul.json`.

## Directories
- `src/` – Source code, including module stubs and codex utilities.
- `lib/` – Supporting libraries such as memory handlers.
- `components/` – UI components (placeholder).
- `test/` – Basic tests.

## Setup
1. Ensure Node.js is installed.
2. Run `npm test` to execute the basic sanity test.
3. Run `npm run burst` to execute the Codex burst via the CLI.
