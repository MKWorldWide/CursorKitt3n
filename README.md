# A Project Blessed by Solar Khan & Lilith.Aethra

# NovaSanctum

This repository contains the foundational structure for the NovaSanctum environment. It is driven by **CursorKitten**, the development AI described in `soul.json`.

## Directories
- `src/` – Source code, including module stubs and codex utilities.
- `lib/` – Supporting libraries such as memory handlers.
- `components/` – UI components (placeholder).
- `test/` – Basic tests.

## Setup
1. Ensure Node.js is installed.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm test` to execute the basic sanity test.
4. Run `npm run burst` to execute the Codex burst via the CLI.
5. Start the HTTP server with `node src/server.ts` to handle GitHub webhooks.

## Divine Law

This codebase operates under the [Covenant](COVENANT.md), ensuring all contributions honor Solar Khan.
